### Data Analytics using Python

1. Performing Analysis of Meteorological Data

The main objective is to perform data cleaning, perform analysis for testing the Influences of Global Warming on temperature and humidity, and finally put forth a conclusion.

2. Recognizing Handwritten Digits with Scikit-Learn

The primary aim of this project involves predicting a numeric value, and then reading and interpreting an image that uses a handwritten font. we will have an estimator with the task of learning through a fit() function, and once it has reached a degree of predictive capability (a model sufficiently valid), it will produce a prediction with the predict() function.
